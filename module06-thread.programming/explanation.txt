I. Multitasking -> 1CPU -> Concurrency
1. MultiProcess
   Critical Task
   Process Programming -> Heavy-weight
   Process -> Heap, Stack, Text, Data

2. Thread
   Thread Programming -> Light-weight
   Better Resource (CPU/Memory) Utilization -> Better Throughput
   Thread ->        Stack

II. Parallel Programming -> Multicore -> GPU

Application Architecture:
Multi Process -> chrome
Single Process Multi Thread -> mysql, mongodb
Multi Process Multi Thread -> oracle -> distributed programming
